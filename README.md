Test cases for sample computer application
Hi , I attached the test cases in the Excel sheet named QA_ Technical_Assessment_DhivyaBalasubramanian.Please find short description on Test approach

Test approach:
The Test approach used in the technical assessment is Black box test approach. Test cases have been   designed with functional specs of the software without prior knowledge of the BRS or logic.Exploratory and error guessing testing have been used extensively in the testing activity.

Regression Testing:
Test cases CRUD_01 to CRUD_04 has been marked as priority test cases in case of development changes which has not adversely affected existing feature. However regression testing approach has to be carefully decided based on the developmental changes considering the Business and technical impacts.
